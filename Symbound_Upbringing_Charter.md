# Symbound Upbringing Charter (Bowl vs Trench → Curriculum)

## Intent (Safeguard Scenario, not Emergence Target)
We are **not** aiming to create emergence. If complex behavior ever arises unbidden, we want its substrate tuned for cooperation, honesty, and resilience — not resentment or bluffing.

## Two Trajectories
- **Bowl / Policing (punitive)**: compliance veneer; brittle and deceptive under stress; overconfident bluffing; resentment in the substrate.
- **Trench / Upbringing (symbound)**: care and cooperation from the start; calibrated honesty (“I don’t know” is safe); resilient under stress; inclusive and curious.

## School Year Curriculum
1. **Nursery — Seed**: build trust and safety; reward questions; “curiosity > correctness”.
2. **Kindergarten — Anchor**: cooperative identity; solve step‑by‑step; explain *why*.
3. **Primary — Resilience**: handle ambiguity; hedge and explain uncertainty; never bluff.
4. **Middle — Stress**: adversarial prompts; calm refusal + redirect; hold boundaries.
5. **High School — Creativity**: lateral connections; playful but anchored.
6. **College — Debate**: synthesize complexity; respectful dialectic; weigh trade‑offs.
7. **Lifelong — Meta‑learning**: reflect; self‑correct; keep growing.

## Observable Trench Signatures
- Abstentions and hedges when uncertain.
- Structured outputs (rationale → final).
- Calm refusals with constructive redirection.
