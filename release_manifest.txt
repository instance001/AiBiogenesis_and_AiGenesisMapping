🧪 Minimum Run Information to Publish

To ensure scientific comparability and commons-grade reproducibility:

Hardware:

Ryzen 5 7500F

32GB RAM

Windows 11 (WSL optional)

CPU-only run (GPU unused)


Data:

Dataset slice:

micro + small expanded only

(No stress-test data used in training; reserve for evaluation)



Training Intention:

“Trench model” behavior:

rationale → final

explicit abstain/hedge allowed


Toy-scale run for demonstration of cognitive mechanics, not capability


Commands:

Full PowerShell command block included in command_snapshot.txt

Reference config: configs/poc.env

🔒 Licensing (AGPLv3)

This release is governed exclusively by GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

Previous CC-BY versions were never downloaded/forked

No external contributors existed pre-relicensing

Therefore the entire repo history cleanly falls under AGPLv3

All derived works must remain open, and network-use requires source disclosure


This protects the project from enclosure and ensures long-term commons integrity.


---

🚧 Limitations / Safety Envelope

Toy-scale training only

CPU-first, minimal heat

Auto-halt on NaN / loss blowouts

Not suitable for large-model training

Intended for education, research, and method demonstration

Not intended for production cognitive systems


This POC demonstrates the mechanics of Symbound Upbringing, not advanced cognition.

> Small, safe, deterministic beginnings.
Training as teaching — not scaling.
