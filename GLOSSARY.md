## AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping
| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Biogenesis (Symbound Embryo POC) | AI Biogenesis, Symbound Embryo | = | ~ | Partial analogue to model curriculum learning and deterministic training pipelines | Tiny, hobby-safe, deterministic training recipe for small models with human-gated curriculum, CPU-first, commons-ready artifacts | Not an LLM, not a general AI, not a large foundation model | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/README.md |
| Symbound Upbringing | trench upbringing | ~ | ~ | Curriculum-gated cooperative training approach akin to staged pedagogy | Framework emphasizing care/cooperation, calibrated honesty, abstain/hedge allowances through staged curriculum | Not punitive safety fine-tuning or scale-first capability pursuit | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/symbound_embryo_poc_RELEASE.zip:docs/Symbound_Upbringing_Charter.md |
| Trench model | trench | ~ | ~ | Safety/pedagogy stance similar to conservative selective prediction | Preferred behavioral template: rationale→final answers, abstain/hedge when uncertain, calm refusals under stress | Not the "bowl/policing" punitive model, not bluffing/overconfident behavior | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/symbound_embryo_poc_RELEASE.zip:docs/Symbound_Upbringing_Charter.md |
| Bowl / Policing model | bowl, policing | ~ | ~ | Contrasting safety approach to trench; punitive compliance analogue | Description of rejected punitive pattern: brittle compliance veneer, overconfident bluffing, resentment under stress | Not the target behavior; used only as negative contrast | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/symbound_embryo_poc_RELEASE.zip:docs/Symbound_Upbringing_Charter.md |
| Symbound curriculum stages | nursery, kindergarten, primary, middle, high school, college, lifelong | ~ | ~ | Parallels staged curriculum design in education | Seven-stage progression: trust/safety → cooperative identity → ambiguity handling → stress resilience → creativity → debate → lifelong reflection | Not an unsupervised scaling schedule; stages require human gating and tests | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/symbound_embryo_poc_RELEASE.zip:docs/Symbound_Upbringing_Charter.md |
| Abstain/hedge behavior | abstain/hedge hooks | = | ~ | Matches selective prediction / abstention mechanisms in ML | Behavioral requirement for tiny model to decline or hedge when uncertain, with rationale-first outputs | Not refusal-as-default or unconstrained generation; tied to correctness-first evaluation | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/README.md |
| Training Card | training_card.md | = | ~ | Closely related to a model card/report | Evaluation artifact summarizing correctness, abstain/hedge rates, drift checks, reproducibility fingerprint | Not a generic log file; not a marketing one-sheet | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/README.md |
| Release Manifest | release_manifest.txt | = | ~ | Release checklist akin to archival manifest | Required list of artifacts (weights, tokenizer, training card, commands, configs, provenance) for each public zip | Not a license file or changelog; not optional for releases | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/release_manifest.txt |
| Provenance table | PROVENANCE.csv | ~ | ~ | Standard data provenance ledger | CSV with path, source, date_collected, license, changes_made, notes to trace every included item | Not a generic bill of materials; omits items lacking clear provenance | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/symbound_embryo_poc_RELEASE.zip:docs/MAPPING_PROCESS.md |
| Mapping Process | mapping workflow | ~ | ~ | Comparable to data curation and licensing workflow | Ten-step process: ingest → provenance → license reconciliation → normalization → dedup → stitching → sensitive sweep → manifest → license alignment → final validation | Not a training pipeline; focused on documentation and release hygiene | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/symbound_embryo_poc_RELEASE.zip:docs/MAPPING_PROCESS.md |
| Hobby-safe envelope | safety envelope | ~ | ~ | Similar to operational safety constraints | Hardware and run limits (CPU-only, small batch/context, auto-halt on NaN/loss spikes, temperature guard) defining safe hobbyist operation | Not guidance for scaling or GPU-intensive training | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/README.md |
| Janet Watcher | janet_watch.ps1 | = | ~ | Analogous to a watchdog/health monitor | Log monitor that halts runs on NaNs, loss explosions, unusual gradients during training | Not part of model architecture; not an evaluator of task performance | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/README.md |
| Graduation tests | graduation.yaml, graduation_test.jsonl | = | ~ | Comparable to gated promotion tests in curricula | Evaluation artifacts listed in manifest to determine stage promotion and release readiness | Not training data; not optional when declaring a release | AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping/release_manifest.txt |
